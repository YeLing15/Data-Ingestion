Data science is a driving force of today's information age. The specialised ETH Master's programme in data science, offered in collaboration with the Department of Mathematics as well as the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, provides a high-quality education geared towards nurturing the next generation of data scientists. It is a two-year programme fully taught in English.
Computers have fundamentally changed the way the world produces, manages, processes, and analyses data. In light of the continuous growth of data all around the globe, the question of how we can use data to gain valuable insights is more important than ever. How can we extract relevant information from massive amounts of data? In which way can computers learn from experience to make intelligent decisions? These questions are key to the specialised Masterâ€™s programme in data science.
Research in the field of data science requires solid skills in managing and storing massive amounts of data as well as the ability to develop efficient mathematical algorithms for data analysis. These techniques are employed in complex applications in engineering and science.
Part of the programme is the Data Science Laboratory, where students tackle specific and practical problems of interdisciplinary applications. In this course students engage in all tasks - from the process modelling to the implementation and validation of data science techniques.
Compact and profound program: The specialised Master's programme in data science equips students with all relevant knowledge and skills while combining theoretical foundations with practical experience.  Personal choice of industry: Medicine, finance, or environment: data science is used in most fields and thus enables graduates of the programme to work in their industry of choice.
High demand in the labour market: Regardless of the industry, most large companies have data scientists working for or with them (e.g. banking, insurance, pharma, telecommunications).
