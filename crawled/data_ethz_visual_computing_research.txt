Paragraphs:
The area of visual computing at the department spans research activities in computer graphics, computer vision, digital geometry processing, human-computer interaction, image analysis and visualisation. These different areas all focus on the processing of visual information. While computer graphics and visualisation aim to generate visual information from models or data, computer vision and image analysis focus on extracting information from visual data. Similarly, an important aspect of human-computer interaction consists of observing humans and their movements to facilitate interaction with machines.



Machine learning and artificial intelligence both have a tremendous impact on visual computing, and recent advances in deep learning have led to completely new ways of extracting information from visual data and modelling the world around us.
