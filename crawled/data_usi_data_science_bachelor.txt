Paragraphs:
For the first three semesters, students follow a mandatory core programme. In the fourth semester, they choose one of the streams in "Informatics" or "Finance & Economics". The two streams will diversify towards more methodological or more applied directions. There will be the possibility of choosing electives in the fifth and sixth semesters.
A unified knowledge base bridges the Finance & Economics and Informatics streams, spanning courses throughout the entire six-semester programme.
In the fourth semester, students can delve into the specializing Finance & Economics stream or immerse themselves in the specializing Informatics stream.
