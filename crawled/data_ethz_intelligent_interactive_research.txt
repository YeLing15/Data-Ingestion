Paragraphs:
Interactive artificially intelligent systems such as personalised robots, self-driving cars and AR/VR-based systems that co-exist and collaborate with humans are increasingly becoming part of our everyday reality. However, many scientific challenges must be overcome before such interactive agents can contribute to solutions to some of humanityâ€™s most urgent problems, including urban congestion and mobility, rising healthcare costs, an aging society, technical literacy and digitisation, and climate change.
