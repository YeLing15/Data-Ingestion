Paragraphs:
One of the central challenges of our time is managing and gaining insights from massive amounts of data through a new research paradigm that is often referred to as “data science”. At its core, data science is mainly composed of data management and machine learning – two areas that are well-represented in the department with substantial interaction and collaboration between researchers. The faculty’s research covers all aspects of the data value chain: the generation and acquisition of data, data organisation and storage, data processing, and learning from data making predictions and decisions.
